<h1>My Hobbies</h1>
<hr/>

<h2>1. Cycling</h2>
<p>I really enjoy something that gets my body moving, and one of those things is cycling. Cycling not only allows me to exercise but also provides the opportunity to explore and enjoy beautiful natural scenery. It has become one of my ways to relieve stress.</p>

<h2>2. Swimming</h2>
<p>In addition to cycling, I also enjoy swimming. Since I was a child, I've had an interest in fauna, and marine life is one of my many favorites. That's why I've always been enthusiastic about swimming, and it has become a hobby that I continue to enjoy.</p>

<p>Maybe that's all for my hobbies, not many but this small things really bring me enjoyment and excitement of life, thank you for your time</p>
